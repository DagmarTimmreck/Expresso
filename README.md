# Expresso

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, you will build all of the routing and database logic for an internal tool for a coffee shop called Expresso.

The Expresso internal tool should allow users to:
- Create, view, update, and delete menus
- Create, view, update, and delete menu items
- Create, view, update, and delete employees
- Create, view, update, and delete employee's timesheets

You can view all of this functionality in action in the video below:

## How To Begin

## Implementation Details

To complete this project, you will need to create the database tables and API routes specified below.

To test this functionality you can run the testing suite and interact with the API via the provided front-end. If you want more data to interact with in the front-end, you can run the **seed.js** file to add data to your database.

We've provided an empty **migration.js** file for you to write table creation logic in.

In order for the tests to run properly, you will need to make sure to:
- Create and export your Express app from a root-level file called **server.js**
- Accept and set an optional port argument for your server to listen on from `process.env.PORT`
- Accept and set an optional database file argument from `process.env.TEST_DATABASE` in all Express route files that open and modify your database
- Use the root-level **database.sqlite** as your API's database

## Testing

A testing suite has been provided for you, checking for all essential functionality and
edge cases.

To run these tests, first, open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install
all necessary testing dependencies (if you haven't already).
Finally, run `npm test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output
about why each failing test failed.

As you implement functionality, run the tests to
ensure you are creating correctly named variables and functions that return the proper values.
The tests will additionally help you identify edge cases that you may not have anticipated
when first writing the functions.
